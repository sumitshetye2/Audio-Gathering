# Audio-Gathering
Repository for a module I'm working on for CMPM 290A. It involves periodically gathering voice input, saving it as text, and (soon) using an LLM to generate stories or gossip based on the saved text


# How to Use on personal machine

1. Copy the repository to your local machine

2. In VSCode terminal (or any terminal) navigate to where you saved the files

3. run ```npm install``` to install the necessary dependencies
4. run ```node server.js``` to start server
5. follow link given by server start. Should look something like ```http://localhost something something something```
